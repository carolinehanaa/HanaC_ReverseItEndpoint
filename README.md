Reverse it - enter random numbers or letters and it will put them in reverse
Peer Review- Kenneth Fujimura -- Everything works well! The program takes in and accurately reverses whatever string is inputted into it. I couldn't really find any bugs. I really liked how you stored everything in an array that had a 'char' data type. That wasn't something I thought to do but probably should have. Great job Caroline! 10/10 A+

Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.
